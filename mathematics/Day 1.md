# Complex Analysis Tutorial Questions

## Question 1: Analytic Functions

a) Define an analytic function and state the Cauchy-Riemann equations in both Cartesian and polar form. Derive the polar form. b) Show that an analytic function with constant modulus is constant. c) Show that e^z is analytic for all z.

## Question 2: Harmonic Functions

a) Define a harmonic function. b) Show that u = sinx + coshy + 2cosxsinhy + x² - y² + 4xy is harmonic and find the corresponding analytic function. c) Construct the analytic function and prove that the following function is harmonic: u = sin(x)cosh(y). d) Find the analytic function f(z) = u + iv such that v(r,θ) = r²cos(2θ) - rcos(θ) + 2.

## Question 3: Linear Transformations

Find the linear transformation which maps the points z₁ = 2, z₂ = i, z₃ = -2 into the points w₁ = 1, w₂ = i, w₃ = -1.

## Question 4: Cauchy Integral Formula

a) Derive the Cauchy Integral Formula. b) Use the Cauchy Integral Formula to evaluate the following integrals: i) ∮(z² + 1)/(z - 2)³ dz, where the contour is |z| = 3 ii) ∮e^z/(z² + 4) dz, where the contour is |z - 1| = 2
