For Questions 1 and 2, there are several key formulas that you'll need to use:

## Question 1: Analytic Functions

### Key Formulas:

1. **Cauchy-Riemann Equations (Cartesian form)**:
    
    - ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y
    - ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x
    
    Where f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)
    
2. **Cauchy-Riemann Equations (Polar form)**:
    
    - ∂u/∂r = (1/r)∂v/∂θ
    - ∂u/∂θ = -r∂v/∂r
    
    Where f(z) = u(r,θ) + iv(r,θ)
    
3. **Modulus of a complex function**:
    
    - |f(z)| = √(u² + v²)
4. **Euler's formula** (for showing e^z is analytic):
    
    - e^z = e^(x+iy) = e^x(cos y + i sin y)

## Question 2: Harmonic Functions

### Key Formulas:

1. **Definition of Harmonic Function**:
    
    - A function u(x,y) is harmonic if it satisfies Laplace's equation:
    - ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0
2. **Finding the conjugate harmonic function v**:
    
    - Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find v from u
    - This often involves partial integration of the equations
3. **Converting between Cartesian and Polar coordinates**:
    
    - x = r cos θ
    - y = r sin θ
    - r² = x² + y²
    - θ = arctan(y/x)
4. **Harmonic conjugate relationship**:
    
    - If u is harmonic, there exists a function v such that f(z) = u + iv is analytic
    - v is called the harmonic conjugate of u

These formulas will be essential for solving the problems in Questions 1 and 2.
