# Curve Types
1. Spline Curve
	1. Piecewise cubic Spline
		1. Hermite Spline
		2. Cardinal Spline
		3. Kochanek-Bartels Spline
	2. Bezier Spline
	3. B-spline
	4. Beta-spline
## Interpolation and approximation splines
1. Interpolation:
	Curve passes through the point
2. Approximation curves
	Points are for general control and curve does not pass through the points
# Curve continuity
1. Parametric Continuity
	1. Zero Order
		Two Points are joined
		P(t=1)=Q(t=0)
	2. First Order
		first order derivitives are equal
		P'(t=1)=Q'(t=0)
	3. Second Order
		second order derivitives are equal
		P''(t=1)=Q''(t=0)
2. Geometric Continuity
	1. Zero Order
		Two Points are joined
		P(t=1)=Q(t=0)
	2. First Order
		first order derivitives are propotional
		i.e. same tangent vector direction but not the magnitude
	3. Second Order
		first and second derivitive are proportional
