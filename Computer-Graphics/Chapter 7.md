# Computer animation
process of creating moving images or sequences by using software
## Key concepts:
1. Keyframes
	Frames where significant changes occur
2. Interpolation
	Process of generating intermediate frames between key frames 
3. Rigging
4. Motion capture
5. Physics based animations
6. Procedural animation

# Computer Animation Functions
1. Creating Movement
2. Simulating Real World
3. Visualizing Concepts and Ideas
4. Entertainment
5. Creating visual effects (VFX)
6. Character Animation and Rigging
7. Designing Animation and worlds
8. Creating Interactive Content
9. Designing and Marketing
# Raster animations
- uses raster graphics
- pixel based
- Examplre : GIFs
### Raster animation techniques
1. Traditional Raster animation
	Hand drawn
2. Digital
	Using digital drawing tools
3. Pixel art
	Each pixel is placed in a low resolution Image

## Raster vs. Vector Animation:

| Feature             | Raster Animation                           | Vector Animation                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image Type          | Uses pixels (bitmap-based images).         | Uses mathematical paths and shapes.                       |
| Scalability         | Loses quality when scaled (pixelation).    | Scalable without loss of quality.                         |
| Detail              | High level of detail and texture.          | Limited in detail (depends on complexity of shapes).      |
| File Size           | Larger file sizes due to high resolution.  | Smaller file sizes due to use of paths and shapes.        |
| Animation Technique | Frame-by-frame drawing or manipulation.    | Can be manipulated with fewer frames using interpolation. |
| Best For            | High-quality textures and detailed frames. | Simple, scalable shapes and smoother animations.          |
#  Key-frame system
steps:
1. Define Key Moments
2. Place Key-frames
3. Interpolation(tweening)
4. Adjust In-Between frames
5. Play and refine

types:
1. Position animation
2. Rotation animation
3. Scale animation
4. Color and Opacity animation

| Feature      | Keyframe Animation                          | Procedural Animation                      | Motion Capture                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Approach     | Defines specific key moments and interpolates. | Generates motion through algorithms.    | Captures real human movements.          |
| Control      | High control over individual movements.     | Less control, but more automation.       | High realism but less control over final result. |
| Flexibility  | Very flexible with frame adjustments.       | Less flexible, based on algorithms.      | Flexible for capturing complex movements, but difficult to modify afterward. |
| Application  | Used for 2D and 3D character animation, object movements, etc. | Used for physics-based simulations, like water, fire, etc. | Used for realistic human motion in films and games. |
