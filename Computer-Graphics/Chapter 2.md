## 4. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm

  

### **Steps:**

1. **Define Region Codes:**

- Assign a 4-bit code to each endpoint based on its position relative to the clipping window.

- Bits represent **top, bottom, right, and left**.

  

2. **Trivial Acceptance & Rejection:**

- If both endpoints have a region code of `0000`, the line is **completely inside** and accepted.

- If the logical **AND** of both endpoints' codes is not `0000`, the line is **completely outside** and rejected.

  

3. **Clipping the Line:**

- Select a point **outside** the window (non-zero region code).

- Compute intersection with the clipping boundary using:

$$

x = x_1 + (x_2 - x_1) * (y_{ ext{clip}} - y_1) / (y_2 - y_1)

$$

$$

y = y_1 + (y_2 - y_1) * (x_{ ext{clip}} - x_1) / (x_2 - x_1)

$$

- Update the endpoint and repeat until the line is inside the window.

  

4. **Repeat Until** the line is fully clipped or accepted.

# Liang-Barsky Line Clipping Algorithm

## **Introduction**
The **Liang-Barsky algorithm** is an efficient method for **line clipping** against a rectangular **clipping window**. It uses **parametric equations** and avoids unnecessary computations, making it faster than Cohen-Sutherland clipping.

---

## **Algorithm Steps**

### **1. Define the Clipping Window:**
- Given a rectangular window with boundaries:
  - \( x_{min}, x_{max} \)
  - \( y_{min}, y_{max} \)

### **2. Define the Line Parametrically:**
- A line segment is given by endpoints \((x_0, y_0)\) and \((x_1, y_1)\).
- Parametric equations:
  $$
  x = x_0 + t (x_1 - x_0) \\
  y = y_0 + t (y_1 - y_0)
  $$
  where \( t \) varies from **0 to 1**.

### **3. Compute the Differences:**
- Define:
  $$
  \Delta x = x_1 - x_0, \quad \Delta y = y_1 - y_0
  $$

### **4. Compute Parameters for Window Edges:**
- For each boundary, compute the parameter:
  $$
  p_i = -\Delta x, \Delta x, -\Delta y, \Delta y
  $$
  $$
  q_i = x_0 - x_{min}, x_{max} - x_0, y_0 - y_{min}, y_{max} - y_0
  $$

### **5. Determine Entering and Leaving Points:**
- For each edge:
  - If \( p_i = 0 \), the line is **parallel** to this boundary.
    - If \( q_i < 0 \), the line is **outside** and rejected.
  - Compute parameter \( t_i \):
    $$
    t_i = \frac{q_i}{p_i}
    $$
  - If \( p_i < 0 \), it is a **potential entering** point.
  - If \( p_i > 0 \), it is a **potential leaving** point.

### **6. Find the Clipped Line Segment:**
- Compute **t_{min}** (largest entering) and **t_{max}** (smallest leaving):
  - If \( t_{min} > t_{max} \), **reject the line**.
  - Otherwise, compute the clipped endpoints:
    $$
    x_{clipped0} = x_0 + t_{min} \Delta x, \quad y_{clipped0} = y_0 + t_{min} \Delta y
    $$
    $$
    x_{clipped1} = x_0 + t_{max} \Delta x, \quad y_{clipped1} = y_0 + t_{max} \Delta y
    $$

## **Advantages of Liang-Barsky Algorithm**
‚úÖ More efficient than Cohen-Sutherland (fewer comparisons and divisions).  
‚úÖ Works well for arbitrary-sized rectangular clipping windows.  
‚úÖ Uses simple parametric calculations for fast execution.

# **Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping algorithm**
The **Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping algorithm** is a technique used in computer graphics to clip a polygon against another polygon (commonly a rectangular window). It is an extension of the **Sutherland-Hodgman** algorithm and is particularly useful for **concave polygons** and **polygonal clipping regions**.

### **How It Works**

The Weiler-Atherton algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Identify Intersection Points**
    
    - Find the intersection points between the subject polygon and the clipping polygon.
    - Insert these intersection points into the subject polygon‚Äôs edges.
2. **Classify Points**
    
    - Determine whether each vertex of the subject polygon is **inside** or **outside** the clipping polygon.
3. **Traverse and Construct Output Polygon(s)**
    
    - Use the intersection points to split the polygon into multiple parts.
    - Depending on whether you are clipping a polygon **inside** or **outside**, you follow different traversal rules:
        - **For filling inside:** Follow the subject polygon until an intersection, then switch to following the clipping polygon.
        - **For filling outside:** Follow the subject polygon, skipping inside portions.
4. **Output the Resulting Clipped Polygon(s)**
    
    - The result is a new polygon that fits within the clipping region.
### **Text Clipping in Computer Graphics**

Text clipping is a technique used to restrict the rendering of text within a specific boundary or clipping region. It ensures that text does not overflow or interfere with other graphical elements in an application.

### **Types of Text Clipping**

1. **Simple Text Clipping**
    
    - If a character is completely inside the clipping region, it is displayed normally.
    - If a character is partially inside, only the visible portion is rendered.
    - If a character is completely outside, it is not displayed.
2. **All-or-Nothing Clipping**
    
    - If a character is fully inside the clipping region, it is displayed.
    - If a character is partially or fully outside, it is completely removed.
3. **Character Clipping**
    
    - Each individual character of the text string is clipped based on the clipping region.
    - Useful for cases where only part of a text string should be visible.
4. **Word Clipping**
    
    - Instead of clipping individual characters, entire words are clipped.
    - If a word cannot fully fit inside the clipping region, it is removed.
    - Common in text editors and UI layouts.
5. **Ellipsis Clipping**
    
    - If text is too long to fit in the given space, an ellipsis ("...") is added at the end.
    - Common in UI/UX design when displaying truncated text.

### **Applications of Text Clipping**

- UI/UX design (buttons, labels, menus)
- Computer-aided design (CAD)
- Digital typography
- Graphics rendering in games and applications

# Line filling
# Scan-Line Algorithm

The **scan-line algorithm** is a fundamental technique used in computer graphics for filling polygons and rendering images. It processes an image line by line (scan line by scan line) rather than pixel by pixel, making it an efficient method for rasterization.

## How Scan-Line Works

1. **Initialize**:
    
    - Identify the polygon(s) to be filled.
        
    - Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum y-values).
        
2. **Process Each Scan Line**:
    
    - Find intersections of the scan line with polygon edges.
        
    - Sort intersection points by x-coordinates.
        
    - Fill pixels between pairs of intersections.
        
3. **Edge Table & Active Edge Table**:
    
    - Use an **Edge Table (ET)** to store edges sorted by their y-coordinates.
        
    - Maintain an **Active Edge Table (AET)** to track edges intersecting the current scan line.
        
    - Update AET dynamically as the scan progresses.

# Boundary-Fill Algorithm

The **boundary-fill algorithm** is a region-filling technique used in computer graphics to fill an enclosed area with a specified color. It is commonly used for filling irregular shapes with a boundary defined by a different color.

## How Boundary-Fill Works

1. **Start at a Seed Point**:
    
    - Choose a point inside the enclosed region.
        
    - Check the color of the pixel.
        
2. **Recursive or Stack-Based Filling**:
    
    - If the pixel is not the boundary color and not already filled, change its color.
        
    - Recursively or iteratively process its neighboring pixels (4-connected or 8-connected).
        

## Types of Connectivity

- **4-Connected**: Considers only the left, right, top, and bottom pixels.
    
- **8-Connected**: Considers all surrounding pixels, including diagonals.

# Flood-Fill Algorithm

The **flood-fill algorithm** is a region-filling technique used in computer graphics to fill connected areas of the same color with a new color. It is commonly used in paint programs and game development for replacing color in a bounded region.

## How Flood-Fill Works

1. **Start at a Seed Point**:
    
    - Choose a point inside the region to be filled.
        
    - Check the color of the pixel.
        
2. **Recursive or Queue-Based Filling**:
    
    - If the pixel matches the target color and is not already filled, change its color.
        
    - Recursively or iteratively process its neighboring pixels (4-connected or 8-connected).
        

## Types of Connectivity

- **4-Connected**: Considers only the left, right, top, and bottom pixels.
    
- **8-Connected**: Considers all surrounding pixels, including diagonals.
