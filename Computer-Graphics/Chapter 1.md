# Random Scan display and Vector Scan Display
# Difference between Raster Scan Display and Random (Vector) Scan Display

| Base of Difference  | Raster Scan Display | Random (Vector) Scan Display |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Electron beam**   | The electron beam is swept across the screen one row at a time from top to bottom. | The electron beam is swept to the parts of the screen where a picture is to be drawn. |
| **Resolution**      | It has lower or poor resolution because picture definition is stored as an intensity value. | It has high resolution because it stores picture definition as a set of line commands. |
| **Picture definition** | Picture definition is stored as a set of intensity values for all screen points (pixels) in a refresh buffer. | Picture definition is stored as a set of lines in a display list file. |
| **Realistic display** | The capacity of the system to store intensity values for pixels makes it well suited for realistic display with shadow and color patterns. | These systems are designed for line drawing and can't display realistic shaded scenes. |
| **Image drawing**   | Screen points or pixels are used to draw an image. | Mathematical functions are used to draw an image. |
| **Cost**           | They are cheaper than random display. | It is more expensive than raster scan display. |
| **Refresh rate**    | Refresh rate is 60-80 fps. | All components are drawn 30 to 60 times per second. |
| **Interlacing**     | It uses interlacing. | It doesn't use interlacing. |
| **Editing**         | Editing is difficult. | Editing is easy. |
| **Refresh area**    | Refresh area is independent of picture complexity. | Refresh area depends on complexity of picture. |
| **Smoothness**      | Produces jagged lines. | Produces smooth lines. |
| **Example**         | CRT, TV, Printer | Pen Plotter |
