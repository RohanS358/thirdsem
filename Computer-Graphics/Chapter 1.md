# Random Scan display and Vector Scan Display
# Difference between Raster Scan Display and Random (Vector) Scan Display

| Base of Difference     | Raster Scan Display                                                                                                                        | Random (Vector) Scan Display                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electron beam**      | The electron beam is swept across the screen one row at a time from top to bottom.                                                         | The electron beam is swept to the parts of the screen where a picture is to be drawn.  |
| **Resolution**         | It has lower or poor resolution because picture definition is stored as an intensity value.                                                | It has high resolution because it stores picture definition as a set of line commands. |
| **Picture definition** | Picture definition is stored as a set of intensity values for all screen points (pixels) in a refresh buffer.                              | Picture definition is stored as a set of lines in a display list file.                 |
| **Realistic display**  | The capacity of the system to store intensity values for pixels makes it well suited for realistic display with shadow and color patterns. | These systems are designed for line drawing and can't display realistic shaded scenes. |
| **Image drawing**      | Screen points or pixels are used to draw an image.                                                                                         | Mathematical functions are used to draw an image.                                      |
| **Cost**               | They are cheaper than random display.                                                                                                      | It is more expensive than raster scan display.                                         |
| **Refresh rate**       | Refresh rate is 60-80 fps.                                                                                                                 | All components are drawn 30 to 60 times per second.                                    |
| **Interlacing**        | It uses interlacing.                                                                                                                       | It doesn't use interlacing.                                                            |
| **Editing**            | Editing is difficult.                                                                                                                      | Editing is easy.                                                                       |
| **Refresh area**       | Refresh area is independent of picture complexity.                                                                                         | Refresh area depends on complexity of picture.                                         |
| **Smoothness**         | Produces jagged lines.                                                                                                                     | Produces smooth lines.                                                                 |
| **Example**            | CRT, TV, Printer                                                                                                                           | Pen Plotter                                                                            |
