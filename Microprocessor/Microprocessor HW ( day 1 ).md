## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Program Concept (Von Neumann's Architecture)  
The **Von Neumann architecture** is a foundational computer design concept that **uses a single memory unit to store both data and instructions**, allowing for flexible and efficient processing.

### üîπ Key Features:
- **Unified Memory**: Both instructions and data share the same memory space.
- **Single Bus**: A single bus connects the CPU, memory, and I/O.
- **Sequential Processing**: Instructions are fetched and executed one by one.
- **Stored Program Concept**: Programs are stored in memory as a sequence of instructions.

### üîπ Components:
- **CPU**: Executes instructions.
- **Memory**: Stores instructions and data.
- **I/O Devices**: Interact with external components.
- **Control Unit**: Manages execution.
- **ALU**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
